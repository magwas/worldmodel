This is a maven project, so you have to install maven in order to compile it.
You run 'mvn package' in order to create target/worldmodel.war
Deploy it on your J2EE server (tomcat/glassfish/jboss) as usual.
If you set up an uploader (see upload-worldmodel.sh.example for instructions),
you can install it with 'mvn integration-test' as well.
