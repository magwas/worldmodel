This is a small and simple implementation of a small and simple wiew of the world:

- The world contains things, and relations between things which are also things.

- The things can have a value, represented by a short string.

There are artificial feaures of the model as well:

- The things can have a type, which is also a thing.

- Things should be identifiable, so they all should have an id, which is a value.

- As the world view of one can change over time, things can also have a version (again a value).

This world view is simple to the extent of unuseability. So other features can be
implemented in it, e.g. to have a useful ontology, a platform for collaboration,
or anything you like. (The feature of implemented features is not implemented yet though:)
